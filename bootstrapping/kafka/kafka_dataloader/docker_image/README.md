# Docker image for loading data into kafka.
This is a folder for building the docker image. The image can be found at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hschwrz/simple-producer/general).

The image requires the `tweets.csv` and `btc.csv` to be in the data folder. They are gitignore since we don't want to push it to github.

The program is in the program folder. If you want to run the simple-producer then `cd` into the program folder and run it.

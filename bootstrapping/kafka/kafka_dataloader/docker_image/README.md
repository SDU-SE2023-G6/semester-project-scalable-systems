# Docker image for loading data into kafka.
This is a folder for building the docker image. The image can be found at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hschwrz/simple-producer/general).

The image requires the `tweets.csv` and `btc.csv` file in this folder. This will later be moved into a PV on the cluster.

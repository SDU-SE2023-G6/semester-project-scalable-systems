# Prometheus operator

# First try.
Tried to do the install using this [article](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/kubernetes-monitoring/configuration/configure-infrastructure-manually/prometheus/prometheus-operator/) but couldn't get the role bindings to work.


# Second and working try
Used this [article](https://devopscube.com/setup-prometheus-monitoring-on-kubernetes/) that Tom sent. Currently everyhting but the ingress is setup.
